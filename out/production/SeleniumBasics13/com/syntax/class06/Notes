Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alerts take a complete focus of our main page that we are on.
We cannot proceed further until it is handled

3 types of Alerts :
1. Web Based alerts/ HTML Alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2. Javascript Alert/ browser alert - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                     we cannot inspect
3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium - not windows OS, it is a window

Types of JS alerts :
1.simple alert - click ok
2.confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3.promt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click on cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()

Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact or to switch to a frame
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by webelement

in alerts - switch to an alert manually and switch back automatically
in frames - switch to frame manually and switch back to the main page manually

Interview Question :
How do you handle Alerts in Selenium :
We handle Alerts by using Alert interface
